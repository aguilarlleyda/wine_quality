# Machine learning sommelier: predicting a wine's quality from its physicochemical properties
While a wine's quality highly depends on a person's taste, some studies have tried to predict subjective wine ratings from objective physicochemical characteristics of the wine. The current project is yet another attempt to do so, in this case by relying on simple and commonly used machine learning models. A dataset was used containing information on several wines from both the red and white varieties of Portuguese vinho verde. For each wine, information was available on eleven physicochemical properties of the wine such as acidity, pH, or alcohol content, as well as a 0-to-10 quality rating made by taking the median of three individual ratings. We tried to predict quality ratings from the available physicochemical components by training a series of machine learning models on part of the data. Then we used the rest of the data to evaluate model performance. A random forest outperformed the rest of the models, which included both linear models (linear regression, ridge regression, lasso regression) and more complex techniques (recursive feature elimination, partial least squares regression, polynomial features). The winning random forest model was subsequently improved via hyperparameter tuning. The resulting model predicted data relatively well, although it fared worse with extreme ratings. When examining the importance associated to the model's predictors, we found that higher quality was mainly associated with those wines with more alcohol, less density, less volatile acidity and, only for red wine, also more sulphates.
